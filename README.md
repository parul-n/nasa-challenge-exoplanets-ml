# nasa-challenge-exoplanets-ml
Developed for NASA Space Apps, this ML classifier preprocesses space-related data, tunes hyperparameters via Grid Search, and achieves ~84% accuracy. It includes label optimization, confusion matrix analysis, and classification reports for a reliable, interpretable, deployable solution for astronomers for identification of exoplanets using AI.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Label encoding and optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Easy deployment with Streamlit
- User-friendly interface for predictions
